# Texas Real Estate Trends

The Real Estate Market Trends Analysis project is an end-to-end machine learning solution designed to uncover insights from real estate data. By analyzing key features such as location, price trends, property type, and economic indicators, this project aims to predict property values and detect market trends over time.

## Tech Stack

Python 🐍 (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook (For exploratory data analysis and visualization)
Machine Learning Models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
Data Sources (Public real estate datasets, Zillow, government reports, etc.)

## Key Objectives

- Clean and preprocess real estate data (handling missing values, feature engineering, etc.)
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends and patterns
- Implement and compare various machine learning models for price prediction
- Identify the most influential features impacting real estate prices
- Provide actionable insights into market trends and property valuation
